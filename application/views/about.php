					<p>Art knows no boundaries. With its ability to captivate, inspire, and evoke emotions that we sometimes didn’t even know existed, a world without art is unimaginable.</p>
					<p>And, as technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, digital is now considered to be one of the most powerful and influential communication tools, especially when it comes to sharing your artwork with a worldwide audience.</p>
					<p>Offering the opportunity to showcase your artwork to the masses, connect and engage with other members, maximise exposure, and compete against other artists, Kompetes™ is an innovative, socially driven competition platform that has been developed to encourage artists of all levels to showcase their talents.</p>
					<p>Whether you’re a budding artist or an experienced pro, this online competition will not only provide the ultimate platform to get your work seen, but it has also been designed to encourage artists to realise their full potential by taking their skills onto the next level.</p>

					<p>We firmly believe that it’s healthy for artists to be competitive in their field, giving them a reason to push the boundaries to unleash the extraordinary.</p>
					<p>After all, competition is the key to pushing your talent beyond its bounds, sparking new ideas, and driving creativity.</p>
					<p>But that’s not all… it is also a critical component of any self-evaluation and realisation process, especially when it comes to taking on board criticisms to perfect your craft.  </p>
